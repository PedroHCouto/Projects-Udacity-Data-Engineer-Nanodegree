## Data Modeling with Postgres
Simulating a Startup music streaming called Sparkify, this project brings knowledge of relational database and data modeling together in order to develop one ETL pipeline using python.   
The goal of the project is to create a Postgres database with tables designed to optimize queries on song play analysis. Here were used concepts like OLAP and Fact and Dimension Tables as well as Star Schema in order to create an efficient ETL pipeline that with just a few commands run the necessary queries to generate the database from JSON files.   
At the end of the project, a database with data for multiples analytical task is created and can be used for anyone that would like to use it.
