## Data Modeling with Postgres (SQL)
Simulating a Startup music streaming called Sparkify, this project brings knowledge of relational database and data modeling together in order to develop one ETL pipeline using python.   
The goal of the project is to create a Postgres database with tables designed to optimize queries on song play analysis. Here were used concepts like OLAP and Fact and Dimension Tables as well as Star Schema in order to create an efficient ETL pipeline that with just a few commands run the necessary queries to generate the database from JSON files.   
At the end of the project, a database with data for multiples analytical task is created and can be used for anyone that would like to use it.

## Data Modeling with Apache Cassandra (NoSQL)
Simulating a Startup music streaming called Sparkify, this project brings knowledge of NoSQL Database and Data Modeling together to develop one ETL pipeline to handle data with Apache Cassandra. 
The goal of the project is to use Cassandra due to its characteristics like:
- Denormalized Data Modeling (optimized for fast reading);
- Optimization for writes;
- Linear Scalability;
- High Availability;  

and create a NoSQL Database through an ETL pipeline that processes the data and makes it possible for the analytical team to perform the desired queries on the data with a great performance that Apache Cassandra brings.
